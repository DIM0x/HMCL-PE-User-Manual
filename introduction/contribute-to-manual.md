# Contribute to manual

## What can I do?

You now have three ways to contribute to the writing of the manual.

* ****[**Translate**](../#language-support) content into your own language
* Report a content error, submit [**Issue**](https://github.com/panda-lsy/HMCL-PE-User-Manual/issues) on Github
* Submit new content using [**Pull Request**](https://github.com/panda-lsy/HMCL-PE-User-Manual/pulls)****

## Being a translator

In writing the manual, the administrator found that most of the people in **Discord** are not **native English speakers**, so the complex English tutorials **make it difficult** for them to read. You can use translation software to first translate the English content into your own language, then **embellish it** with spoken language and finally make the manual accessible to a wider audience.

You can do this by changing the file directly and submitting a [**Pull Request**](https://github.com/panda-lsy/HMCL-PE-User-Manual/pulls) for translation.

You can sign up for a free Github account with your own email address and contribute to the manual.&#x20;

### Starting Translation!

First, switch to the language branch you want to translate into.

{% endhint %}

### What can <mark style="color:red;">****</mark> I do before translate a text document?

Before proceeding with the translation you need to know the following:

* [x] Calibrate the HMCL-PE community manual for new versions

![If this is the case then there is no new version, otherwise you need to click Update Branch to update](<../.gitbook/assets/image (19).png>)

* [x] Please do not translate the names of any folders as this could easily result in the site not being able to read the files.

### How do I translate the **SUMMARY**?

All you need to do is find SUMMARY.md and edit it.

The parts marked in <mark style="color:red;background-color:red;">red</mark> like this are the paths to the read files, please do not translate them.
