When you activate the automatically allocate feature, it will allocate your RAM according to the needs of the game.

In different versions of minecraft, you'd better allocate different amounts of memory.

In vanilla minecraft, you can allocate 1024MB-2048MB of RAM, with minimum being 800MB of RAM.

In a modpack with many mods, you may need to allocate more than 4096MB of memory(Of course, you'd better allocate RAM according to the Modpack author's description.)
