### Game launch

You can launch the game via Boat or PojavLauncher.

#### Advantages and disadvantages of the two startup methods (WIP)

| Launcher/Advantages & disadvantages | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| Boat                                |            |               |
| PojavLauncher                       |            |               |

### Renderer

You have two ways to render the game.

#### Holy GL4ES(OpenGL 2.1/3.2)

This renderer is more stable(Manual writer's test conclusions, for reference only)

#### VirGLRenderer(OpenGL4.3)

This renderer will give your game a higher FPS(Manual writer's test conclusions, for reference only)

### FAQ

#### Q:When I use the VirGLRenderer, the game screen turns white during startup and the colors become confused.

A:You need to change the [Resolution](resolution.md).



#### Q:When I opened the game, the screen and the item bar were rendered very unclear
