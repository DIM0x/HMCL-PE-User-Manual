When you initially use HMCL-PE, it does not start version isolation.

Isolation is great feature, it allows you to install multiple minecraft versions in one .minecraft folder and they don't affect each other, which solves a lot of unnecessary troubles, but you have to move your saves manually.

When you use version isolation, each of your minecraft version folders will be in separate folders.

Location: _**`HMCLPE/.minecraft/versions/[game-version]`**_

If you add mods to the mods folder in the main folder after you turn on the isolation, they will not be loaded.
